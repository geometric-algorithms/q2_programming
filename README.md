## Skyline Problem Implementation

**Authors:** Sameer Mannava (210070073) and Satyam Mishra (210040139)

## Overview
This repository contains implementations of skyline algorithms:
- `main.py` - Range tree based skyline algorithm (Part A)
- `skyline_3d.py` - Optimized O(n log n) algorithm for 3D case (Part B)

## Instructions
Run the following commands to execute the algorithms:

```bash
# For generic skyline algorithm
python3 main.py

# For 3D skyline algorithm
python3 skyline_3d.py
